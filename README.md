## What this program does



## What this progran not does



## Why this package was made?

I was dissatisfied with the performance and quality of the apt-cacher-ng package. As under [Ubuntu Bug Tracker](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt-cacher-ng) and [Debian Bug report logs](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=apt-cacher-ng) apt-cacher-ng has some unresolved issues. Some of these have also affected me over the years and have repeatedly hindered my home lab and my company and have repeatedly disrupted normal system operation and CI builds.

That's why I created an alternative with this program that is more in line with my wishes and requirements.
